    "\n",
    "- `Transform Loaders`: These loaders handle different input formats and transform them into the Document format. For instance, consider a CSV file named \"data.csv\" with columns for \"name\" and \"age\". Using the CSVLoader, you can load the CSV data into Documents.\n",
    "- `Public Dataset or Service Loaders`: LangChain provides loaders for popular public sources, allowing quick retrieval and creation of Documents. For example, the WikipediaLoader can load content from Wikipedia.\n",
    "- `Proprietary Dataset or Service Loaders`: These loaders are designed to handle proprietary sources that may require additional authentication or setup. For instance, a loader could be created specifically for loading data from an internal database or an API with proprietary access."

Porém, para que isso aconteça é preciso que o produtor adote o uso de novas tecnologias.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nDesafios enfrentados pelos gestores na pecuária\\nDiante dos vários desafios enfrentados pelos produtores, estão os custos elevados de insumos, a gestão da mão de obra e as variações de mercado. A tomada de decisão precisa ser rápida e equilibrada, ou seja, considerando fatores zootécnicos, sanitários, agronômicos, financeiros e econômicos\\xa0 para garantir a eficiência e a sustentabilidade da produção.\\nAumentar a eficiência da produção significa produzir mais com menos recursos, uma tarefa que exige organização e uma gestão eficaz. A coleta e análise de dados são fundamentais para entender o desempenho da fazenda e identificar áreas de melhoria.\\nPara isso, o produtor precisa acompanhar uma série de indicadores, como taxa de prenhez e nascimento; peso ao desmame e idade; bezerros desmamados por vaca, gmd, custo por @ produzida, desembolso/custo por cabeça/mês. Além disso, é preciso avaliar a pastagem, fazendo um controle das alturas de entrada e saída, quais os lotes estão em cada área e, caso queira aproveitar ainda mais a área da fazenda, planejar e realizar o piqueteamento para pastejo rotacionado.\\nPara poder analisar essas informações é necessário tê-las armazenadas. Com os dados em mãos é possível entender para qual direção a fazenda está indo com relação a eficiência.\\n\\xa0\\nAvanço da tecnologia na gestão da pecuária de corte\\nA pecuária de corte moderna está se beneficiando enormemente das inovações tecnológicas. A transição para a Pecuária 4.0 envolve a adoção de tecnologias digitais otimizando cada aspecto da produção agropecuária.\\nO termo da Pecuária 4.0 deriva do conceito das evolução da Agricultura em “Eras”, onde nós saímos da Era 3.0 chamada de Agricultura de Precisão, que envolvia a aplicação de tecnologias geoespaciais, aplicação localizada de insumos, biotecnologia e uso de softwares agrícolas, para a Era 4.0 ou DIGITAL, na qual já consideramos a utilização da integração de tecnologias avançadas, como a computação em nuvem, Big Data, Internet das Coisas (IoT), inteligência artificial, automação e análise de dados, para otimizar cada aspecto da agricultura. Essa evolução permitiu aos agricultores dados em tempo real sobre suas culturas, condições climáticas e recursos, facilitando decisões informadas que aumentam a eficiência e a produtividade.\\nPor outro lado, quando falamos da Pecuária, esta atividade começou a usar as tecnologias mais tarde porém de forma muito mais acelerada.\\xa0 O termo “Pecuária de Precisão” é uma abordagem similar a Agricultura 4.0, porém focada na criação de gado. Ela envolve o uso de tecnologias avançadas, como sensores que coletam dados sobre os animais de maneira individual, além de informações sobre a nutrição, sanidade e pastagens, permitindo com isso uma melhora na gestão de rebanhos de maneira integrada.\\xa0\\nUm ponto chave para a diferença da Agricultura para a Pecuária é a questão da Tempestividade da informação, ou seja, ter informação disponível para tomar uma decisão antes que ela perca a sua capacidade de ser útil. Como a pecuária tem um ciclo mais longo e muito dinâmico, conseguir analisar rapidamente um problema\\xa0 para tomar uma ação é o que vai determinar lucro ou prejuízo no final do ciclo.\\nJá começa a se falar também da Pecuária 5.0 que vai além, introduzindo a análise de dados em tempo real e a predição de resultados, permitindo ajustes imediatos e informados nas estratégias de manejo.\\xa0\\nEssa nova era trará como benefícios para as fazendas:\\n\\nAumentar cada vez mais\\xa0 a produtividade e rentabilidade das propriedades\\nTer maior rapidez na análise de problemas e correções\\nTer maior segurança dos funcionários e nos processos e manejos estão sendo realizados adequadamente\\nOtimizar o uso insumos e consequentemente redução nos custos de produção\\nOtimizar o uso de recursos naturais e diminuição dos impactos ambientais\\nDiminuir riscos relacionados a questões externas, como oscilação de preços, desastres naturais, fatores climáticos, etc.\\n\\nE como isso será possível? Cada vez mais vamos ver o uso de sensores e equipamentos automatizados para coleta de dados. Uso de imagens e sensoriamento remoto para várias aplicações, desde medir a qualidade do pasto, pesar animais e até após o abate para avaliação de carcaças.\\xa0 Com uma disponibilidade cada vez maior de conectividade no campo, dados obtidos de dispositivos (IOT) e sensoriamento remoto através de constelações de satélites que monitoram a produção em tempo real aumentarão de forma exponencial a quantidade de dados disponíveis.\\nNeste ponto, a inteligência artificial (IA) passará a ter um papel incrivelmente importante, processando uma massa de dados que crescerá exponencialmente, tornando realidade todos esses benefícios. É importante reconhecer que a jornada rumo à Pecuária 5.0 não é apenas uma questão de implementar tecnologias avançadas, mas sim uma transformação cultural e organizacional. Vamos passar por uma transformação também do perfil dos profissionais que estão trabalhando no campo. Os técnicos, agrônomos, veterinários, zootecnistas, gestores, todos terão que estar preparados para utilizar e aplicar adequadamente estas tecnologias para aumentar a produtividade e escalar o atendimento aos fazendeiros.\\n\\nQuer saber mais sobre esse tema?\\nAssista nosso webinar: Inteligência na gestão da pecuária de corte\\n\\n\\xa0\\nO papel da JetBov na transformação da gestão da pecuária\\nA JetBov desempenha um papel crucial na transformação da gestão da pecuária de corte ao integrar tecnologia de ponta com práticas de gestão inovadoras.\\xa0\\nUtilizando aplicativos como o JetBov de Campo e JetBov de Pasto, a empresa facilita a coleta de dados em tempo real, de forma automatizada.

From a theoretical point of view Probably approximately correct learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.\\n\\n\\n== History and relationships to other fields ==\\n\\nThe term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period.Although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells. Hebb\\'s model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.By the early 1960s an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyze sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to re-evaluate incorrect decisions. A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson\\'s book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P,  improves with experience E.\" This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing\\'s proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machin'"

      "this little wafer contains photosensitive pixels made with a semiconductor that is fabricated from copper and I'm not going to lie this wafer has totally kicked my butt results have been at times exciting this does that look at that and at times pretty discouraging that's a week's worth of work down the drain and I get to start over again which is just great and more than a few times I've accidentally blown up what I was testing oh it went this will probably be a long one so buckle up today we're talking about DIY semiconductors to make advanced electronics and light sensitive devices you need a semiconducting material and while silicon is obviously the most popular semiconductor it's not the only one there are dozens of different semiconducting materials out there being studied for a whole variety of reasons but the one I'm most interested in is copper oxide the oxidized state of plain old copper copper oxide is a ptype semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.2 electron volts we don't need to get into exactly what that means but what you should know is that it's sensitive to visible light visible light photons have enough energy that they can knock electrons loose inside the material which in turn generates an electrical current this is the basis of a photovoltaic cell basically a solar cell so copper oxide allows us to build photosensitive sites on a wafer and if we wire those up with electrodes we can build a little camera with light sensitive pixels this will be a good test of both the semiconducting layer and the necessary extra bits like depositing electrodes and probing the resulting circuit to actually grow the oxide I'm following a thermal oxidation protocol from this nature paper First We Take a silicon substrate and grow a thick layer of silicon dioxide on top which is done at 1,000° in a furnace we need to grow this oxide so that there is a physical barrier between the experiment and the underlying silicon it would be uh pretty silly to go through all this effort to make a copper oxide device and then realize we were actually measuring the Silicon substrate instead we could of course just use a different substrate and Skip all of this initial prep but silicon is just convenient it's very flat relatively cheap and the insulating oxide is easy enough to grow next we deposit a thin layer of copper on top using magnetron sputtering I'm depositing 80 NM of copper for all of my tests then we oxidize the copper to make our semiconductor this is where it starts to get a little complicated so far I've been saying copper oxide but there are actually two different types there's copper 1 oxide also known as cupris oxide which has this formula and then there's copper 2 oxide also known as cupric oxide having this formula we're mostly interested in copper 2 oxide copper 1 is also a semiconductor but has a larger band Gap around 2.1 electron volts which means it's not quite as sensitive to visible light if you heat copper up to around 200° C you'll mostly generate that copper 1 oxide but as the temperature increases you'll convert that copper 1 into copper to so we put our sample inside the furnace and crank it up to 700° C and leave it there for an hour which is where the first problem started to happen my tube furnace just has an analog control method and if you're not careful the temperature can kind of fluctuate and swing if the temp swings a bit too high the oxide has a tendency to ball up and form these geometric patterns it's actually like really beautiful to look at but it's entirely useless as an aside I think these geometric patterns are due to the Copper oxide following the underlying Crystal orientation of the Silicon which is not going to lie it's pretty cool but it's also you know not at all usable so we have to rerun the experiment but keep a better eye on temperature and try to air on the side of cooler so I completely forgot to mention the adhesion problems that I ran into uh the original paper makes a note of this in the methods it says quote a strip array configuration of copper is patterned for the sensing film to alleviate the adhesion problem during the following high temperature analing process basically they used thin narrow strips of copper oxide instead of a continuous film because the smaller surface area has less internal stress and so it's less likely to peel off and I definitely found this to be a problem if you have a single continuous film across the whole substrate it's highly likely that it'll peel off you usually like an hour or a day later uh you actually get big flakes of the film just kind of coming right off so it's totally unusable their method definitely works having a smaller cross-section I also found that 5 nanom of titanium underneath the copper is an effective adhesion promoter between the substrate and the copper uh it probably does mess with the semiconducting properties a little bit cuz now you've got titanium mixed in but yeah it was easier than trying to do\n"

       "\"bem-vindo de volta à série de teclado personalizado do zero, da última vez que criamos nosso layout, definimos nosso switch Matrix selecionou nosso microcontrolador e escolheu nossos recursos opcionais, se você não tiver feito alguns deles, tudo bem, mas você terá que fazê-los eventualmente para a placa de demonstração  Estou criando, estou usando um layout padrão de 60% no Mega 32 u4 e incluirei pinos para um display OLED neste vídeo criaremos o esquemático e o PCB que começa com a chave CAD kycad é um software gratuito e de código aberto para  projetando placas de circuito impresso e esquemas instale a versão mais recente do kycad e crie um novo projeto, você será saudado por dois arquivos, um esquema e um PCB, abra o esquema, vamos primeiro apresentar as teclas de atalho mais úteis e permite adicionar componentes gerais, como  resistores diodos interruptores e microcontroladores M permite que você mova um símbolo R permite que você gire esse símbolo e P permite que você coloque símbolos de potência como trilhos de tensão e aterramento agora que você sabe como colocar os componentes vá em frente e coloque seu microcontrolador para mim isso é no Mega 32 u4 eu normalmente começo com o microcontrolador, pois é o coração do projeto que diz que você está livre para trabalhar na ordem que desejar. Devo informar que os passivos são definidos por sua letra característica, então um resistor é  simplesmente r um capacitor c um diodo D e um indutor L pacotes mais complexos, como microcontroladores, normalmente recebem seus nomes completos conforme você coloca os componentes, você deve preferir suas folhas de dados para visualizar diagramas e esquemas de implementação típicos, alguns são melhores que outros, mas são todos  repleto de informações úteis, uma coisa digna de nota é que os sites ocasionalmente possuem links para folhas de rosto ou detalhamentos de séries no lugar de folhas de dados. Geralmente, são muito menores do que a folha de dados real e contêm muito poucas informações. A folha de dados adequada para o 32 u4 é  438 páginas Agora seguirei a folha de dados para adicionar os componentes necessários para inicializar este microcontrolador com o 32 u4 que inclui a colocação de um capacitor de 100 nanofarad em cada pino de alimentação, a colocação de um capacitor de 1 microfarad no ukap e a adição de um resistor pullup de 10K e  botão de puxar para baixo no pino de reset, é assim que atualizaremos esta placa. Adicionarei resistores da série de 22 ohms a cada linha de dados USB e, finalmente, adicionarei o cristal, o cristal requer um capacitor em cada lado, os valores para estes são normalmente cerca de 10 picofarad, mas pode ser calculado a partir da folha de dados do Crystal, o 32 u4 requer um Crystal de 16 MHz, mas isso varia para diferentes microcontroladores com essa infraestrutura de suporte completa, é hora de adicionar USB tipo c porque não sou bobo, recomendo o  Receptáculo USB 2.0 para tipo c pois possui todos os pinos necessários para suporte C Toc e reversibilidade você pode deixar o escudo e sbu desconectado pressionando Q no topo do pino colocará um X no topo indicando que não está conectado você também deve adicionar  dois resistores pull down de 5,1 kohm nas linhas CC, se você esquecer de incluí-los, sua placa só funcionará com cabos USB a para c e não com cabos C para C. Finalmente, conectarei o terra USB ao terra e vbus a mais 5 volts, normalmente  não incluí um, mas você pode querer incluir um IC de proteção USB, são basicamente alguns diodos xener que despejam picos de tensão nas linhas de dados USB para aterrar, isso é o que eu tenho, mas o seu provavelmente será diferente, vamos agora passar para a matriz do switch outra parte mais importante será grande, então vou criar uma nova planilha com o nome da tecla S, alternar Matrix e clicar duas vezes nela para entrar na nova planilha. Vou começar colocando um único interruptor e um diodo e depois estender os cabos  para criar uma célula vou copiar tudo referenciando o desenho que fizemos na primeira parte vou colar conectando- os até ter o número apropriado de colunas então você pode copiar tudo novamente e colar nas linhas remover quaisquer células extras  de Matrix novamente seguindo seu desenho como referência, isso é o que recebo para o quadro de demonstração Agora preciso rotular e anotar The Matrix Usarei rótulos globais colocados com contrl shift L para dar a cada linha e coluna um rótulo para que possa  ser acessado a partir da planilha principal agora anote a planilha clicando no botão anotar na faixa de opções selecionando classificar símbolos pela posição y e clicando em anotar isso conclui o trabalho para a Matriz você pode retornar à planilha principal pressionando alt backspace você pode agora adicionar  quaisquer recursos opcionais, como codificadores de LEDs ou displays para LEDs, eu poderia fazer uma segunda folha formatada algo assim para codificadores e displays, apenas os coloco na folha principal ao trabalhar com o SSD 1306, coloco um conector genérico de quatro pinos e combino os pinos  para meu módulo quase pronto, se você estiver usando um STM 32 ou similar, você precisará adicionar um regulador de tensão para reduzir os 5 volts do USB para 3,3 Volts para simplificação. Eu recomendaria o AMS 1117 ldo, que deve caber perfeitamente  aqui você também vai querer alguns capacitores de filtro adicionais para acompanhá-lo, jogue 10 microfarad na entrada e na saída e você deve estar configurado, não se esqueça de usar símbolos de potência para marcar cada tensão como uma consideração final Você pode querer incluir um  Cabeçalho ISP para que você tenha uma segunda maneira de atualizar seu microcontrolador se algo der terrivelmente errado, este seria o cabeçalho S swd para usuários stm32 neste ponto, você deve ter um esquema quase completo, você está livre para copiar os rótulos de seu switch Matrix e atribuí-los aos pinos do microcontrolador, mas achei isso mais fácil de fazer quando fiquei satisfeito com o posicionamento dos interruptores e do microcontrolador em minha PCB, isso nos leva à atribuição de espaço e seleção de componentes, vamos começar com calma com os interruptores de chave, se você estiver indo totalmente  custom você provavelmente já sabe quais switches pretende usar, caso contrário, você pode solicitar um testador de switch para encontrar seus favoritos Eu gosto de switches Cherry e acho que hot swap é rei, então vou atribuir soquetes cereja hot swap para meus switches para  para fazer isso, primeiro precisamos de uma biblioteca de componentes, felizmente, uma está disponível através do gerenciador de conteúdo CAD principal, navegue até a janela principal do CAD principal e clique na guia plugin e gerenciador de conteúdo para bibliotecas e instale o interruptor de chave Biblioteca, aplique as alterações e feche, você precisará então  para incluir essas bibliotecas, navegue até as preferências, gerencie as bibliotecas de espaço e adicione esses caminhos, clique em OK e retorne ao seu esquema para atribuir os espaços recém-adicionados, execute a ferramenta de atribuição de espaço na faixa superior, anote automaticamente o restante do seu esquema, se necessário, e selecione todas as suas chaves  switches e atribua o espaço apropriado para os switches ou soquetes hot swap que você pretende usar Eu começo atribuindo a tudo um espaço oneu e depois atualizo manualmente os switches que precisam de tamanhos diferentes para atualizar manualmente você pode clicar com o botão direito em um switch e selecionar editar espaço ou pressionar F Você  você pode querer se referir ao Json original que você exportou do seu mapa de teclado na primeira parte o pacote mais fácil para atribuir uma pegada é o microcontrolador a folha de dados deve listar os pacotes ou o fornecedor do qual você pretende fazer o pedido deve listar o pacote associado ao  componente que você está prestes a encomendar, em muitos casos, o kycad ainda tem pacotes pré-atribuídos para microcontroladores para USBC. Gosto do conector hro 31 M12, pois ele fez tudo o que eu precisava fazer e provou ser fácil de soldar, o restante deve ser capacitores, resistores, dodes e um  cristal, caberá a você escolher os componentes que correspondam ao valor correto e sejam um pacote adequado. Basicamente, uso exclusivamente pacotes de montagem em superfície smt neste ponto e tenho livros de amostras em 0402. Os componentes 0402 são como grãos de areia, portanto, você pode querer dar uma olhada  no pacote 126 smt ou em pacotes passantes, como o d207, se você pretende fazer um furo passante, apresentará alguns desafios aqui, pois os interruptores precisam ficar rentes ao PCB e seu teclado provavelmente ficará com pouco espaço, uma última coisa digna de nota é  que você não precisa atribuir cada espaço agora, você pode pular para o design do PCB agora e voltar conforme necessário e usar o design atual para ajudar a escolher um pacote que caiba no espaço disponível, então vamos fazer isso. Vou pular a atribuição  minhas passagens de pegada por enquanto e pular para o PCB, precisamos de uma última coisa do nosso esquema, embora uma lista de rede kycad Funciona em redes, uma rede é basicamente um ponto comum ou nó de circuito, cada pino recebe uma rede, como mais 5 volts de aterramento  ou um de seus rótulos, esse pino precisa se conectar a todos os outros pinos também atribuídos a essa rede para obter a lista de rede, vá para exportar arquivo, lista de rede, salve-o em uma área comum, abra o PCB e vá importar arquivo, carregar e testar a lista de rede em seguida, atualize seu PCB, agora você deve ver uma pilha de chaves e alguns outros componentes. Gosto de colocá-los fora da planilha para começar a trocá-lo, desta vez começarei com a matriz de switch ou layout, pois faz mais sentido aqui, mas  primeiro, precisamos alterar as configurações da grade, selecionar a grade, editar a grade do usuário e, em seguida, definir a grade definida pelo usuário para 19,05 por 19,05 mm, até onde eu sei o espaçamento padrão, você está livre para definir como quiser, mas eu descobri  para estar correto, você pode querer dividir a parte X desta grade por alguma boa potência de dois, como 2 4 8 ou 16, mas vou deixar isso, esta é uma unidade inteira por enquanto, clique em ok e selecione o usuário Grid é  agora é hora de colocar as teclas, você pode mover itens com a tecla m como antes, mas eu prefiro uma abordagem mais direta na tecla CAD, pressione t no seu teclado, esta caixa chama o designador de referência de um componente para o seu cursor, desde que o seu esquema de matriz seja semelhante  para o meu, você pode digitar s sw1 e a primeira opção em The Matrix deve ser colocada no cursor, deve ser Escape grave ou qualquer que seja a tecla superior esquerda, coloque-a em algum lugar próximo ao topo da página e repita para chamar a opção dois  3 e assim por diante até chegar ao final da linha, você pode então chamar a próxima tonalidade e iniciar a próxima linha, repita isso até que sua Matriz esteja completa e você possa finalmente dividir a grade, se ainda não o fez, para terminar o arranjo I  acabei com isso, agora vou pular para a grade padrão de 0,254 mm e mover meu microcontrolador para ver onde ele se encaixa melhor. Também vou virá-lo para colocá-lo no mesmo lado da PCB que meus soquetes hot swap você definitivamente precisará manter o controle da orientação aqui por padrão, vermelho é o cobre frontal e azul é o cobre traseiro, certifique-se de não espelhar acidentalmente sua placa, você pode pressionar alt três para ver uma renderização 3D da placa, finalmente, se o seu  switch Matrix fica pendurado na planilha, você pode ir para a configuração da página do arquivo e alterar o tamanho da página para melhor caber antes de ir muito mais longe, você deve anotar as direções do rastreamento, já que os rastreamentos não podem se cruzar, você precisa cruzar acima ou abaixo, como tal.  Eu recomendo usar um lado do seu quadro para traços horizontais e usar o lado oposto para traços verticais. Você pode usar o Vias para alternar camadas, dessa forma você não fica preso em um canto, exigindo refazer grandes seções do layout do traço, eu acho.  finalmente tenho que falar sobre a seleção de componentes, isso é difícil para mim, não sei o que dizer além de escolher componentes que correspondam às suas especificações e que você possa soldar. Encontrar componentes pode ser difícil, então onde procurar, gosto do LCS c como os preços são baixos e os tempos de envio são mais lentos. Mouser ou Digi key também funcionam, mas espere pagar 10 vezes mais pelos passivos. Coisas maiores, como microcontroladores, geralmente têm o mesmo preço, use tantos filtros quanto possível para encontrar o que você precisa. filtrar por valor, depois por pacote e depois por preço, também pode incluir um estoque instantâneo, bem como ocultar o valor do material fora de estoque e descontinuado, é fácil, está no esquema, mas e o pacote que é uma coisa pessoal, leva tempo e experiência para  saiba com quais pacotes você gosta de trabalhar Eu gosto do pacote microscópico 0402, pois ele economiza muito espaço, especialmente em torno de microcontroladores. Aconselho um iniciante a ficar bem longe deles, embora eu ache que este projeto tem espaço para 1206, então isso será  minha recomendação geral, se você não tiver certeza, reduza-a conforme achar adequado. Uma recomendação para iniciantes que nunca pesquisaram componentes antes é começar com os resistores e capacitores, pesquisar e filtrar os resistores e capacitores e adicioná-los ao seu carrinho  primeiro, isso lhe dará um pouco de prática com os filtros e, esperançosamente, o preparará para solicitar seu microcontrolador e quaisquer outros componentes que você possa precisar, dada a escolha entre diodos de uso geral e diodos de choque, você deve escolher choques para sua matriz, pois eles reagem um pouco mais rápido, mas são piores no bloqueio de corrente, usarei o pacote sod 323 nesta placa e escolherei um diodo razoável, mas principalmente aleatório, do meu fornecedor de componentes. Adicionarei esses diodos e desenharei minhas linhas e colunas, o que me deixará com um estrutura como esta agora provavelmente não é um mau momento para rotear o vbus da entrada USB, certifique-se de que cada pino VCC receba energia e que você não esteja se bloqueando, isso pode ser complicado, então não tenha medo de fazer várias tentativas enquanto nós '  re roteando do USB, vamos falar também sobre as linhas de dados USB O USB pode tolerar alguns abusos, mas você deve aprender a impedir e quebrar esses traços O USB tem uma impedância característica de 90 ohms para dar aos nossos traços aquela impedância característica do Chara, devemos calcular sua largura aberta  abra as ferramentas da calculadora na guia linha trans Eu normalmente uso plano C ou guia de onda com plano de terra, funciona, mas não é ideal, linha de micro tira acoplada seria a opção correta, mas não parece funcionar no momento em que escrevo basicamente você pode deixar os padrões além da altura que você deve definir para a espessura entre o traço e o solo, isso é provavelmente 1,6 mm, em seguida, defina o nó Z para 90 ohms, defina a folga do solo por como s e clique em sintetizar, esta é a espessura  suas linhas de dados USB devem ser, se forem realmente finas, certifique-se de que sejam largas o suficiente para que sua Boardhouse possa funcionar, você pode encontrar essas informações na página de recursos da Board House, você pode arredondá-las para cima ou para baixo, apenas tente mantê-las aproximadamente nesse tamanho.  use 0,15 mm, pois eu sei que a largura mínima do jlc é 0,127 MM para placas de duas camadas, você também deve rotear os rastreamentos de dados como pares diferenciais. Isso pode ser feito clicando e segurando o botão de rastreamento e arrastando para o botão de pares diferenciais, certifique-se de que os dados  mais e dados menos As redes têm um sinal de mais e menos no final, o que significa um par de diferenças para a chave CAD, em seguida, basta desenhar os traços no quadro, tomando cuidado para evitar chegar muito perto de quaisquer outros traços, as duas últimas coisas sobre as quais preciso falar são Cortes de borda e aterramento na borda. camada de cortes desenhe o contorno do seu PCB Afastei-me cerca de 2 mm da borda dos interruptores e coloquei meu ponto de borda Cortes Também arredondei os cantos assim que tiver seu ponto de borda Cortes no lugar, você deve selecionar a ferramenta Preenchimento de zona selecione todos  suas camadas de cobre e preencha usando terra, configure-a com suas folgas e clique na caixa OK, toda a placa complete o retângulo e clique duas vezes na zona, agora você deve ter uma grande zona colorida que representa o terra, certifique-se de que ela se conecte a todos os componentes que precisam de terra e  verifique se há lacunas que você deseja usar Vias para costurar a parte superior e inferior deste poro, use Vias para trazer o poro do solo para qualquer área grande onde ele possa estar apenas na parte superior ou inferior, com isso deixarei você encaminhar o  resto da sua placa e para colocar seus componentes de uma maneira que pareça fácil de montar, tome cuidado para revisar sua placa algumas vezes e certifique-se de que tudo está realmente conectado O Ninho do Rato deve mostrar a você, mas pode ser fácil perder, definitivamente execute o RDC que irá informá-lo sobre quaisquer problemas com sua placa, alguns podem ser ignorados com segurança e outros serão críticos, você também deve gastar algum tempo limpando suas camadas de seda, organizar quaisquer designadores de referência que você planeja usar e adicionar quaisquer ovos de Páscoa que desejar no placa final, você também pode adicionar um número de versão em algum lugar para saber em qual revisão de hardware você está, para uma aparência realmente limpa, considere remover os designadores de referência e adicionar um jlc jlc jlc sob o microcontrolador na camada de seda, se você estiver usando jlcpcb isso oculta o número do pedido quando a placa estiver totalmente montada, uma vez que você fez uma revisão final e está feliz, é hora de exportar Gerbers, vá para o arquivo plot e crie uma pasta Gerbers e clique em plot, você também deseja criar arquivos de perfuração  no mesmo local eu uso os padrões para todos eles sem problemas, você pode usar o visualizador Gerber e importar os Gerbers para ver o que o Boardhouse vai obter, certifique-se de que tudo esteja certo quando estiver completamente satisfeito, navegue até onde você salvou  esses arquivos e compactá-los, em seguida, arraste e solte-os em sua Boardhouse, configure as propriedades adequadas da placa e faça o pedido enquanto você retira seu cartão, não se esqueça de solicitar seus componentes também, isso conclui a parte dois, espero que tenha sido útil como antes, saia alguns comentários abaixo me informando o que perdi e o que devo fazer no futuro\""

      "welcome back to the custom keyboard from  scratch series last time we created our  layout defined our switch Matrix  selected our microcontroller and picked  our optional features if you haven't  done some of these that's okay but you  will have to do them eventually for the  demo board I'm creating I'm using a  standard 60% layout the at Mega 32 u4  and will include pins for an OLED  display in this video we'll create the  schematic and PCB which starts with key  CAD kycad is free and open source  software for designing printed circuit  boards and schematics install the newest  version of kycad then create a new  project you'll be greeted by two files a  schematic and a PCB open up the  schematic let's first introduce the most  useful hotkeys a allows you to add  General components such as resistors  diodes switches and microcontrollers M  allows you to move a symbol R allows you  to rotate that symbol and P allows you  to place power symbols such as voltage  rails and ground now that you know how  to place components go ahead and place  your microcontroller for me that's the  at Mega 32 u4 I typically start with the  microcontroller as it's the heart of the  project that said you're free to work in  whatever order you'd like I should let  you know that passives are defined by  their characteristic letter so a  resistor is simply r a capacitor c a  diode D and an inductor L more complex  packages such as microcontrollers  typically go by their full names as you  place components you should prefer to  their data sheets to view typical  implementation diagrams and schematics  some are better than others but they're  all jam-packed with useful information  one thing of note is that websites  occasionally link to cover sheets or  series breakdowns in place of data  sheets these are typically much smaller  than the actual data sheet and contain  very little information the proper data  sheet for the 32 u4 is 438 pages long  I'll now follow the data sheet to add  the required components to boot this  microcontroller for with the 32 u4 that  includes placing a 100 nanofarad  capacitor at each Power Pin placing a 1  microfarad capacitor on ukap and adding  a 10K pullup resistor and pull down  button to the reset pin this is how  we'll flash this board I'll add 22 ohm  series resistors to each USB data line  and finally I'll add the crystal the  crystal requires a capacitor at each  side values for these are typically  around 10 picofarad but can be  calculated from the Crystal's data sheet  the 32 u4 requires a 16 MHz Crystal but  this will vary for different  microcontrollers with that supporting  infrastructure complete it's time to add  USB type c cuz I'm no fool I'd recommend  the USB 2.0 receptacle for type- c as it  has all the necessary pins for C Toc  support and reversibility you can leave  the shield and sbu disconnected pressing  Q at top of pin will place an X at top  it indicating that it's not connected  you should also add two 5.1 kohm pull  down resistors on the CC lines if you  forget to include these your board will  only work with USB a to c cables and not  C to C cables finally I'll connect USB  ground to ground and vbus to plus 5  volts I typically fail to include one  but you may wish to include a USB  protection IC it's basically a few xener  diodes which dumps voltage spikes on the  USB data lines to ground this is what I  have but yours will likely differ let's  now move on to the switch Matrix the  other most important part  this will be large so I'll create a new  sheet with the S key name it switch  Matrix and double click it to enter the  new sheet I'll start by placing a single  push switch and a diode then extend the  leads to create a cell I'll copy the  entire thing referencing the drawing we  made in part one I'll paste connecting  them until I have the appropriate number  of columns then you can copy the entire  thing again and paste in the rows remove  any extra cells from The Matrix again  following your drawing as a reference  this is what I get for the demo board I  now need to label and annotate The  Matrix I'll use Global labels placed  with contrl shift L to give each row and  column a label so it can be accessed  from the main sheet now annotate the  sheet by clicking the annotate button in  the ribbon selecting sort symbols by y  position and clicking annotate this  completes the work for the Matrix you  can return back to the main sheet by  pressing alt  backspace you can now add any optional  features such as LEDs encoders or  displays for LEDs I might make a second  sheet formatted something like this for  encoders and displays I just throw them  in the main sheet when working with the  SSD 1306 I place a generic four pin  connector and match the pins to my  module almost done if you're using an  STM 32 or similar you'll need to add a  voltage regulator to get the 5 volts  from USB down to 3.3 Volts for  Simplicity I'd recommend the AMS 1117  ldo which should fit just\n"

    "Once you've loaded documents, you'll often want to transform them to better suit your application. The simplest example is you may want to split a long document into smaller chunks that can fit into your model's context window. LangChain has a number of built-in document transformers that make it easy to split, combine, filter, and otherwise manipulate documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to deal with long pieces of text, it is necessary to split up that text into chunks. As simple as this sounds, there is a lot of potential complexity here. Ideally, you want to keep the semantically related pieces of text together. What \"semantically related\" means could depend on the type of text. This notebook showcases several ways to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, text splitters work as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split the text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks (often sentences).\n",
    "- Start combining these small chunks into a larger chunk until you reach a certain size (as measured by some function).\n",
    "- Once you reach that size, make that chunk its own piece of text and then start creating a new chunk of text with some overlap (to keep context between chunks).\n",
